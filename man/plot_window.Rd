\title{Plot Event Study Results}
\usage{
plot_window(tab)
}
\arguments{
\item{tab}{Regression table object (typically from fixest::etable()) containing
coefficient estimates for event study variables.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing event study results with:
\itemize{
\item Point estimates and confidence intervals over time
\item Separate panels for RTC vs SYG laws and outcome types
\item Baseline reference line at implementation year - 1
\item Color coding for state vs city models
}
}
\description{
Creates event study plots showing coefficient estimates over time windows
around gun law implementation, with separate panels for different laws
and outcome types.
}
\details{
The plot shows:
\itemize{
\item X-axis: Years before/after law implementation
\item Y-axis: Estimated effect size
\item Reference lines at zero effect and law implementation
\item Error bars showing 95\% confidence intervals (Â±2 standard errors)
\item Facets for different law types and outcome categories
}
}
