\title{Permute Gun Law Implementation Years for Placebo Testing}
\usage{
permute_years(
  ii,
  permute = TRUE,
  jh_state,
  jh_city,
  syg_year_state,
  rtc_year_state
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ii}{Integer. Iteration number for the permutation (used for tracking
multiple permutation runs).}

\item{permute}{Logical. If TRUE (default), randomly permutes the law
implementation years across states. If FALSE, uses original years
(useful for baseline comparison).}

\item{jh_state}{Data frame containing state-level justifiable homicide data
with columns for state, year, and outcome variables.}

\item{jh_city}{Data frame containing city-level justifiable homicide data
with columns for state, city, year, and outcome variables.}

\item{syg_year_state}{Data frame containing state-level SYG law implementation
years with columns for state and year.}

\item{rtc_year_state}{Data frame containing state-level RTC law implementation
years with columns for state and year.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing regression coefficients for key law variables
(shall_issue, syg_law, rtc_law, SYGxRTC) from both state and city models,
with an iteration identifier.
}
\description{
This function performs placebo testing by randomly permuting the years when
Stand Your Ground (SYG) and Right-to-Carry (RTC) laws were implemented across
states, then fits regression models to test whether the observed effects could
have occurred by chance.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item Permutes law implementation years across states (or keeps original if permute=FALSE)
\item Creates binary law indicators based on permuted years
\item Fits multiple regression models to both state and city data
\item Returns coefficients for law variables to assess statistical significance
}
