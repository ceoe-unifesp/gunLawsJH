\title{Create Placebo Test Visualization}
\usage{
plot_sim_placebo(tab)
}
\arguments{
\item{tab}{Character. Which table to plot ("table03" for state models,
"table04" for city models).}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing histograms of permuted coefficients faceted
by model and law term, with original coefficients marked and p-values
calculated based on permutation test.
}
\description{
This function creates a histogram plot showing the distribution of coefficients
from placebo permutations, with the original coefficient marked as a vertical
line to assess statistical significance.
}
\details{
The plot shows:
\itemize{
\item Histogram of coefficients from permuted data
\item Vertical dashed line showing original coefficient
\item Shaded area showing more extreme values than original
\item Text showing permutation-based p-value
\item Color coding by original coefficient significance
}
