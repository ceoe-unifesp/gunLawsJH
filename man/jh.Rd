\strong{Justifiable Homicide Categories:}
\itemize{
\item Civilian justifiable homicides: Killings by private citizens deemed legally justified
\item Police justifiable homicides: Killings by law enforcement officers deemed legally justified
\item FENC data provides additional police homicide information for robustness checks
}

\strong{Gun Law Variables:}
\itemize{
\item Stand Your Ground (SYG) laws: Expand the right to use deadly force in self-defense
\item Right-to-Carry (RTC) laws: Allow concealed carry of firearms with permits
\item Binary indicators turn on in the year of law implementation and remain active
}

\strong{Control Variables:}
Economic, demographic, and political controls are included to account for
confounding factors that might affect both gun laws and homicide rates.
LEOKA (Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted) data captures police-citizen
interactions that may influence justifiable homicide rates.
