\title{Add Event Study Time Windows for Gun Law Analysis}
\usage{
add_windows(da)
}
\arguments{
\item{da}{Data frame containing state-level data with binary law indicators
(syg_law, shall_issue) and year information.}
}
\value{
Data frame with additional columns for time distances from law
implementation at different window sizes (1, 2, 3, and 10 years), converted
to factors for regression analysis.
}
\description{
Creates time distance variables for Stand Your Ground (SYG) and Right-to-Carry
(RTC) laws to enable event study analysis with different time windows around
law implementation dates.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item Identifies first year each law was implemented per state
\item Calculates distance (years) from implementation for each observation
\item Creates windowed versions capping distances at specified limits
\item Converts distance variables to factors for event study regressions
}
}
