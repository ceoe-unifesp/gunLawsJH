\title{City-Level Justifiable Homicide Data (1978-2020)}
\format{
A data frame with 9,072 rows and 18 columns:
\describe{
\item{id}{Character. Unique identifier combining year, state FIPS code, and city name}
\item{year}{Numeric. Year of observation (1978-2020)}
\item{address_city}{Character. City name and state abbreviation (e.g., "CAPE CORAL FL")}
\item{state_name}{Character. Full state name}
\item{state_fips}{Integer. Federal Information Processing Standards state code}
\item{JH_city_pol}{Numeric. Police justifiable homicides in the city}
\item{JH_city_cit}{Numeric. Civilian justifiable homicides in the city}
\item{poverty_rate}{Numeric. City poverty rate (percentage)}
\item{unemp_rate}{Numeric. City unemployment rate (percentage)}
\item{pct_pop_black}{Numeric. Percentage of city population that is Black}
\item{log_pop}{Numeric. Natural logarithm of city population}
\item{log_police_rate}{Numeric. Natural logarithm of police per 1,000 city population}
\item{pct_pop_18_24}{Numeric. Percentage of city population aged 18-24}
\item{state}{Character. State name in lowercase (for merging with state-level data)}
\item{pct_republican}{Numeric. Percentage of state votes for Republican presidential candidate}
\item{shall_issue}{Numeric. Binary indicator for state RTC laws (1 = law in effect)}
\item{syg_law}{Numeric. Binary indicator for state SYG laws (1 = law in effect)}
\item{SYGxRTC}{Numeric. Interaction term for states with both SYG and RTC laws active}
}

\strong{Key Differences from State Data:}
\itemize{
\item Starts in 1978 (one year later than state data)
\item Contains only cities with sufficient reporting coverage
\item Gun law variables are inherited from state-level implementation
\item Some controls (like political variables) remain at state level
}

\strong{Geographic Coverage:}
The dataset includes major cities across all states, with varying numbers of
cities per state based on population and reporting consistency. This allows
for analysis of within-state variation in gun law effects.

\strong{Clustering Considerations:}
City-level models typically cluster standard errors at both state and city levels
to account for correlation within geographic units and over time.

A dataset containing city-level justifiable homicide counts for major US cities
from 1978 to 2020, used to examine gun law effects at finer geographic resolution
than state-level analysis.
