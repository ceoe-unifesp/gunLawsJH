\title{Fit All Model Specifications}
\usage{
fit_model_all(formula_list, da_state, da_city)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula_list}{List of formula specifications created by create_formulas(),
containing formulas, model types, and clustering specifications.}

\item{da_state}{Data frame containing state-level justifiable homicide data.}

\item{da_city}{Data frame containing city-level justifiable homicide data.}
}
\value{
Named list with fitted model objects for each table specification
(table03, table04), each containing a list of 5 fitted models.
}
\description{
Fits negative binomial regression models with fixed effects for all
formula specifications using appropriate datasets (state vs city level)
and clustering structures.
}
\details{
For each formula specification:
\itemize{
\item Models 1-3: Fit using state-level data with state clustering
\item Models 4-5: Fit using city-level data with state+city clustering
\item All models use fixest::fenegbin() for negative binomial regression
\item Progress bar displayed during fitting process
}
}
