Description: Replication package for "Gun Laws and Justifiable Homicides: 
    Contrasting Impacts on Civilians and Police?" This package provides 
    datasets and functions to reproduce the analysis examining the association 
    between right-to-carry and stand-your-ground laws and justifiable homicides 
    committed by civilians and police officers. Includes state and city-level 
    data from 1977-2020, regression modeling functions, event study analysis, 
    and novel placebo permutation tests for robustness checking.
